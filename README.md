# My Own Hugo Scaffold

### An npm managed hugo scaffold

This scaffold allow for a clean, organised content management, separated from the main configuration. It's managed from the very beginning by npm, to allow for remote building and deploying with no troubles due to versions mismatch or breaking changes. Being coupled by the node ecosystem, it also allow to extend the already brilliant hugo pipes with complementary tasks.
